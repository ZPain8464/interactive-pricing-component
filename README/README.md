## About

This was a challenge I found on Frontend Mentor, a site that provides free real-world mockups to help developers improve their FE skills. I chose this project because I love clean layouts, and it seemed like a good project to utilize core FE technologies. Nothing fancy â€” just HTML, CSS, and JS.
